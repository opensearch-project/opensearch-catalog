Log in to opensearch dashboards\\n- Navigate to OpenSearch Dashboards.\\n- Log in and verify the logs index was created and contains logs data\\n- Go to Discover tab, select the index name and view the data\\n\\n### 2. Create an Index Pattern\\n-  Go to 'Management' > 'Index Patterns'.\\n-  Click 'Create Index Pattern' and enter the pattern (e.g., logs-*).\\n-  Select the timestamp field (e.g., @timestamp) for time-based data.\\n-  Save the index pattern.\\n\\n### 3. Build Log Queries\\n- Go to the 'Discover' tab.\\n- Use the search bar to filter logs, e.g., `log_level:ERROR` to find all error logs.\\n- For advanced filtering, utilize the Dashboard Query Language (DQL).\\n\\n### 4. Save Your Query\\n- After refining your query, save it by clicking on the 'Save' button in the 'Discover' tab.\\n- Name your saved query for easy reference.\\n\\n### 5. Create Visualizations\\n- Go to 'Visualize' > 'Create Visualization'.\\n- Select the type of visualization you want to create (e.g., bar chart, pie chart).\\n- Choose your saved query as the data source.\\n\\n### 6. Add Buckets for Data Aggregation\\n- In the visualization settings, add buckets to aggregate your data. For example:\\n    - Use 'Date Histogram' for the X-axis to display logs over time.\\n    - Add other metrics or aggregations as needed.\\n\\n### 7. Split Series for Detailed Insights\\n- Add another bucket to split data by specific fields, such as `service.name` or `host.name`.\\n- This will allow you to see log distributions across different services or hosts.\\n\\n### 8. Customize Visualization\\n- Customize the visualization with labels, colors, and other settings to make it more informative and visually appealing.\\n\\n### 9. Save and Add to Dashboard\\n- Save the visualization with a descriptive name.\\n- Navigate to the 'Dashboard' tab and create a new dashboard.\\n- Add your saved visualizations to the dashboard by selecting them from the list.\\n\\n### 10. Finalize and Share\\n- Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard as desired.\\n- Save the dashboard with a meaningful name.\\n- Share the dashboard with your team by generating a shareable link or embedding it in your application.\\n\\n### Tips for Effective Dashboards\\n- Use different types of visualizations to present various aspects of your log data.\\n- Regularly update the time filter to ensure you're viewing the most recent logs.\\n- Take advantage of OpenSearch Dashboards' interactive features, such as drill-downs and filters, for deeper analysis.\\n\\n\"}}"},"id":"8d8e5860-3fc8-11ef-a406-af6eb3c84d77","migrationVersion":{"visualization":"7.10.0"},"references":[],"type":"visualization","updated_at":"2024-07-11T21:00:07.270Z","version":"WzM5LDVd"}
