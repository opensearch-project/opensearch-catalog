# Python Client Integration
The next integration contains instructions and tutorial of setting up python opensearch client and logging applicative telemetry into opensearch.

## Logging with OpenSearch in Python: 

Logging is an important aspect of software development,OpenSearch, is a robust and scalable solution, stands out for storing and analyzing logs efficiently.
This guide walks you through integrating OpenSearch as a storage and analytics into component used in your Python project for effective logging.

### Install Python Libraries
Install the OpenSearch Python client to interact with OpenSearch:

```bash
pip install opensearch-py
```
See additional documentation [here](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/python-low-level/).

## Integrating OpenSearch with Your Python Project

### Step 1: Import the OpenSearch Client
In your Python project, import the necessary module:

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch
```

### Step 2: Establish a Connection
Create a connection to your OpenSearch cluster:

```python
os = OpenSearch([{'host': 'opensearch_host', 'port': 9200}])
```

### Step 3: Indexing Logs
Index your logs into OpenSearch:

```python
log_entry = {
    'timestamp': '2024-02-05T12:00:00',
    'level': 'info',
    'message': 'Your log message here.',
    'source': 'your_python_project'
}

index_name = 'index_name'

os.index(index=index_name, body=log_entry)
```

### Step 4: Querying Logs
Retrieve logs using OpenSearch's powerful search capabilities:

```python
query = {
    'query': {
        'match': {'level': 'error'}
    }
}

result = os.search(index=index_name, body=query)
print(result)
```

## Best Practices for Effective Logging

1. **Descriptive Log Messages**: Include clear and detailed information.
2. **Appropriate Log Levels**: Use different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) to categorize log messages.
3. **Timestamps**: Always include timestamps for chronological analysis.
4. **Contextual Information**: Add details like module, function, or user IDs.
5. **Avoid Redundant Logging**: Balance between sufficient information and avoiding overload.
6. **Secure Sensitive Information**: Do not log sensitive data in plain text.
7. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON for consistent log formats.

## Advanced Features of OpenSearch

- **Index Patterns and Mappings**: Optimize log data structure for better analysis and retrieval.
- **Visualization with Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards for real-time log insights.

## How to build an Application Monitor Dashboard
Based on the ingested logs, lets review the process of generating an informative monitor dashboard for the applicative logs:
